This is a project that I started because I want to learn C, and I thought to myself "why not make a little dungeon explorer?"

Todo:
- Monster population in room
- Implement basic combat system
- Multiple saves
- Update Map style
  - Render each room in the map

Thoughts:
- Potentially make it where each location can only have 1 entity, and make it where you can only attack an entity you are facing
